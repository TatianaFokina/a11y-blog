People now talk about digital accessibility in a casual and general way: It‚Äôs important for *all* users. Of course, that‚Äôs a fair statement, but managers, developers, and other IT professionals need numbers. One source of these numbers is reports based on automated testing of websites and applications, as well as surveys involving real users.

Here, I‚Äôve collected sources with various statistics related to digital accessibility. Some reports focus on the **technical aspects of the accessibility** ‚Äî for example, HTML markup and its common problems, the state of WAI-ARIA, or the websites technology stack.

The second type of statistics the result of surveys enlight the **experiences of users of assistive technologies**. Such data helps us understand accessibility barriers and what user strategies help overcome them. This type of data is the most important.

Another kind of statistics comes from analyzing the **legal regulation and company experiences**. Such reports reveal why businesses implement accessibility, what challenges they face, and what results it brings.

Behind all the numbers are *real* people. Studies and reports only show the tip of the iceberg. Any statistics should be adjusted for external factors and the context of their collection ‚Äî social, legal, and cultural characteristics, as well as disability stigmatization. Always take the numbers from accessibility reports with a grain of salt üßÇ
