This is the first part of two of a series of posts on accessibility, typography, and their friendship ðŸ«‚

The series based on my talk â€³[Accessibility and typography](https://tatianafokina.github.io/talks/a11y-and-typography/)â€³ what I had at Tbilisi A11y & UX Day in November 2024.

## What is readability?

_Readability_ is a characteristic of text that defines how easy it is to read the text. There are three main factors that affect readability:

- personâ€™s unique attributes (health factors),
- the topic of the text,
- typography (the choice of typeface and how itâ€™s used).

## Readability checklist

- Mood and tone match the audience.
- Complexity is as low as possible.
- Words and sentences are short and plain.
- Sentences use the active grammatical voice.
- There are no spelling and grammar mistakes.
- Readability score is 70â€“100 based on the automatic test.
- There is no critical issues with legibility.

## Notes

### Mood and tone

_Mood_ is the overall feeling of texts. Text mood can be calm, eerie, optimistic, sentimental, etc.

_Tone_ is the creator's feelings about the main topic of the text and their readers. The creator's attitude includes personality traits such as funny, serious, friendly, or sarcastic.

Tone can be polite, neutral or impolite, subjective or objective, etc.

### Complexity

_Text complexity_ is its difficulty in reading and understanding.

Text complexity is affected by:

- Purpose: Informational, entertain, persuade, etc.
- Structure: The way how the ideas are organized.
- Layout: How visual elements of the text are presented.
- Visual supports: Heavy/light use of images and media content.
- Language features: Clarity of the language including vocabulary, sentence structure, and style.
- Knowledge demands: Assumptions about a readerâ€™s life experiences.

### Sentences, words and voice

Readable words should be plainspoken. It's better to avoid long words and replace them with similar, shorter ones if possible.

Longer sentences are usually harder to break down than concise ones. Avoid convoluted sentence structures with many clauses and conjunctions.

Active voice points out who or what is performing an action in the sentence. It includes active verbs. For example, â€³The cat ate the food.â€³

## Testing and tools

Readability is calculate automatically with readability calculators and grammar checkers.

Readability calculators based on formulas that consider the length of the words and the sentences. Based on that, calculators check the reading level of your text.

The reading level counts in approximate years of education. The perfect readability score should be between 70 to 100. This is 5th to 8th grade. It means that the text is understood by teenagers, young adults, and other people.

Another way to conduct the readability testing is to performÂ the eye tracking test.

Common readability calculators:
